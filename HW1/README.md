# ðŸŽ² Number Guessing Game (Java Console App)

This is a simple number guessing game written in Java. The player tries to guess the number randomly generated by the computer. The game continues until the correct guess is made, providing feedback along the way.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

This project demonstrates the use of:

- Basic Java data types and control structures
- User input/output using `Scanner`
- Random number generation using `Math.random()`
- Conditional statements (`if-else`)
- Looping (`while`)
- List management with `ArrayList`

## ðŸ“‹ Features

1. **Welcome Message**
   - When the program starts, it displays:  
     ```
     Welcome to the number prediction game!
     ```

2. **Random Number Generation**
   - The computer picks a random number between 1 and 100:
     ```java
     int randNum = (int)(Math.random() * 100) + 1;
     ```

3. **User Guessing**
   - The user is prompted to guess the number.
   - Feedback is given:
     - If the guess is too high:  
       `Please enter a smaller number:`
     - If the guess is too low:  
       `Please enter a greater number:`
   - The game continues until the user guesses the correct number.

4. **End of Game**
   - When the correct number is guessed, a success message is shown along with the list of all user guesses.

5. **Bonus Feature**
   - The game prints the list of all guesses the user has made.
